## Generations of Computer Systems

**Moore's law** states that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years

The generations of computers are:

| Generation | Enabling Hardware                                                                                                                        | OS Type                                                        | Attributes                                                                                                                                                 |

| 4          | Very large scale integration (VLSI) allowed for a complete microprocessor to be placed on a single chip, resulting in personal computers | Desktop and laptop OS                                          | OS is responsible for all all operations from boot to scheduling to peripheral devices. Introduction of the GUI                                            |
| 5          | Networking hardware                                                                                                                      | OSs for supercomputers, distributed systems and mobile devices | OS responsible for leveraging more powerful processor speeds through parallel processing. Networking gave rise to the internet and mobile devices          |
