**cache**: temporarily holds a piece of data from a slower memory into a faster memory. There are hardware and software caches. Also an interface (when not transparent):

- Get(), returns:
  - hit
  - miss
- Set()

Questions when dealing with caches:

- when to put a new item into the cache?
- which cache slot to put the new item in?
- which item to remove from the cache when a slot is needed?
- where to put a newly evicted item in the larger memory?

Advantages: shared memory (a), more independent tasks (b)
